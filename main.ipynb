    "> **Answer**: I would start by looking for existing literature as well as already implemented projects. After an initial gathering of understanding I would search for datasets to inspect and look for features to include or exclude in training/testing. After preparing the data for training, i would select a machine learning model based on existing literature projects to train and evaluate using the data selected before. Finally, I would tweak the model and or the dataset in order to improve prediction accuracy. After achieving a minimum required accuracy, i would prepare and present the results and finally deploy the model."

    "> **Answer**: Using binary classification, this model could be used to increase the efficiency of recognizing heart diseases in hospitals early and thus provide appropriate treatment for patients early. This could be done by collecting the vitality parameters of the patients that are needed as featuers for the prediction model. The benefits of this could be an overall increase of health in the population and a dicrease in fatal cases of heart diseases."
