    "> **Answer**: I would start by looking for existing literature as well as already implemented projects. After an initial gathering of understanding I would search for datasets to inspect and look for features to include or exclude in training/testing. After preparing the data for training, i would select a machine learning model based on existing literature projects to train and evaluate using the data selected before. Finally, I would tweak the model and or the dataset in order to improve prediction accuracy. After achieving a minimum required accuracy, i would prepare and present the results and finally deploy the model."

This could be done by collecting the vitality parameters of the patients that are needed as featuers for the prediction model. The benefits of this could be an overall increase of health in the population and a dicrease in fatal cases of heart diseases."

    "**Question**: *What does a score of 1 represent? Explain the phenomena*\n",
    "> **Answer**: The prediction score of 1 represents a 100% accuracy for predicting heart diseases for a given input. This happens for the prediction of the training data, because it already knows the data from training and has a bias towards it. This can be an indicator for overfitting, although the relatively high accuracy for the training data does not implicate overfitting in this case."

    "> **Answer**: A confusion matrix is split into four categories, two of which are on the x and two are on the y axis: X = [Actual Positive, Actual Negative] and y = [Predicted Positive, Predicted Negative]. This can be used to compare the predicted results to the actual results.\n",
    "In addition, the confusion matrix can be used to calculate precision, recall, and the F1 score.\n",
    "The precision is the amount of predicted positives that are actually positive.\n",
    "The recall describes the amount of actual positives that were identified. The key difference to the precision is that the precision only takes the predicted positives into account, while the recall takes all predictions into account.\n",
    "The F1-Score is calculated from recall and position and can be used as the mean between those two metrics. It can be seen as the combination of both false positives and false negatives. "

In a process called \"bootstrap sampling\", multiple variants of descision trees are created during training with different subsets of data to be used for training, which are selected randomly. The randomness for results can be prevented by setting a seed for the random generation."
